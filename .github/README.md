<h3 align= "center"> This is an open-source fork of the Steam-Card-Bot-PRO project, dedicated to providing FREE updates and support. My goal is to keep this essential tool accessible to the community.</h3>

# Note on the Fork

This is a **fork** of the original [Steam-Card-Bot-PRO](https://github.com/Refloow/Steam-Card-Bot-PRO). I have decided to develop and maintain it independently because:
1.  The original project is no longer actively maintained.
2.  The original developer is now only selling a version with more features privately (Overpriced) on their Discord.

I am planning to **update the project over time and keep it free**.

* **Update Frequency:** As I don't earn money from this project, updates will be released as time permits and based on necessity.
* **Support & Stability:** I will **not** be able to provide support for most individual cases. The code may be **unstable** as it is based on existing architecture and not entirely re-coded.

**Currently working on:** Fixing repository links, updating all advertisements, and ensuring consistency after the fork.
